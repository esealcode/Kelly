# Kelly ðŸŒŠ

Kelly is a minimalistic React component set that allow you to create simple as well as complex skeleton screen loading for you app.

There are some key concepts that make Kelly unique

* **Non invasive:** Kelly focus on being the least invasive as possible in your components architecture. This means that there is only wrapping components and nothing else.
* **Minimalistic:** The goal is not to cover every single scenario, instead Kelly comes with a small set of useful React components which are all ruled by the status of your application. Either your application has loaded content, either not.
Those two states are the keystone of a skeleton screen and every components are designed to respond accordingly.
